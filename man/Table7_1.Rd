U.S. Coffee Consumption (Y ) in Relation to Average Real Retail Price (X),* 1970â€“1980
Source: The data for Y are from Summary of National Coffee Drinking Study, Data Group, Elkins Park, Penn., 1981; and the data on nominal X (i.e., X in current prices) are from Nielsen Food Index, A. C. Nielsen, New York, 1981.
I am indebted to Scott E. Sandberg for collecting the data.

The nominal price was divided by the Consumer Price Index (CPI) for food and beverages, 1967 = 100.
