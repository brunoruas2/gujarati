R data package for "Basic Econometrics 5ed" by Damodar N. Gujarati and Dawn C. Porter.

Inpired by Justin's wooldrige package (https://github.com/JustinMShea/wooldridge) i had tried to do the same thing to other great Econometric book.

This is the first version, so the only way to install it is using the package devtools.

If you don't installed devtools, please run the following comand
```
install.packages('devtools')
```
after that run this
```
devtools::install_github('https://github.com/brunoruas2/gujarati')
```

# Usage
to use the Table 1.1, just use `gurajati::Table1_1` and you are good to go.
